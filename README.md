# Deep Learning NNets Assignments Repository

### Requirements
It is recommended to setup a conda env and install pytorch with cuda there because pytorch in python 3.11 is not supported in all operating systems tests gone through conda env in python 3.8

To do this install anaconda or miniconda 
Run:

```console 
conda create -n myenv python=3.8 
```

```console 
conda activate myenv 
```

```console 
git clone https://github.com/ArtoriasAbyssslayer/DeepLearning-NNets.git
```

```console 
cd DeepLearning-NNets
```
update pip and install deps with pip: 
```console 
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

```console 
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
```
